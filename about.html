        <p>Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc. is a Japanese multinational video game publisher owned by Bandai Namco
            Holdings. It was founded in 2006 as Namco Bandai Games Inc., following the 2005 merger of Namco and Bandai.
            Namco acquired Bandai's video game business division through a corporate split. In 2009, Bandai Namco Games
            absorbed Bandai Networks. It is headquartered in Minato, Tokyo.
        </p>

        <p>Development operations were spun off into a new company in 2012, Namco Bandai Studios (now called Bandai
            Namco Studios), to help create faster development time and tighter cohesion between development teams. Namco
            Bandai Games was renamed Bandai Namco Games in 2014 and again to Bandai Namco Entertainment a year later.
